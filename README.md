# Hangman-Game
Hangman Game_band name version

This game is based on the Day 7 Excercise in the "100 Days of code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" course.
After completed my Day 7 lessons and code challenges, I found this is super fun and spent several days rebuilt my own version.
I created a new word bank base on the bands I like and I know, and added some extra features like the recognition of spaces and repeated guessed letters checking condition. 


I had a lot of fun coding on this, try it if you are interested and feel free to fork it to make some changes!
